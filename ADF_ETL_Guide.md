# Azure Data Factory ETL Process: Step-by-Step Guide

## 1. Create Linked Services
- **Description**: Linked Services establish connections to data sources (like Blob Storage) and destinations (like SQL Database).  
- **Why**: This is required to securely fetch or store data.  

---

## 2. Define Datasets
- **Description**: Datasets define the structure and location of the data, representing both source and destination.  
- **Why**: Azure Data Factory uses datasets to know how to interact with the data.

---

## 3. Configure Parameters
- **Description**: Parameters allow us to pass dynamic values (e.g., file names or dates) into the pipeline.  
- **Why**: This ensures the pipeline is reusable without needing manual reconfiguration.

---

## 4. Build a Pipeline
- **Description**: Create a pipeline by adding activities such as **Copy Activity** to move data from the source dataset to the destination.  
- **Why**: The pipeline orchestrates the entire ETL process.

---

## 5. Setup Mapping Data Flow
- **Description**: Configure transformations such as filtering, aggregation, or data cleaning using Mapping Data Flow.  
- **Why**: This ensures data is processed and cleaned before loading it into the destination.

---

## 6. Assign Triggers
- **Description**: Configure triggers to automate pipeline execution based on time schedules or events (e.g., new file uploaded).  
- **Why**: Triggers ensure pipelines run consistently and on time.

---

## 7. Self-Hosted Integration Runtime
- **Description**: Install and configure a self-hosted runtime to access on-premises data sources.  
- **Why**: This enables Azure Data Factory to connect to private networks and securely move data to/from the cloud.

## Conclusion
This guide covers the essential steps to set up and run an ETL pipeline in **Azure Data Factory** using Linked Services, Datasets, Parameters, Pipelines, Data Flows, Triggers, and Integration Runtime. By following these steps, you can build dynamic, automated, and scalable data pipelines.
